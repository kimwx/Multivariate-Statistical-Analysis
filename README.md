A Study of COVID-19 Data - Do Intervention Policies Matter?

As COVID-19 continues to spread, the eyes of the world have been focused on it. Different demographic and cultural characteristics of the population play an important role in determining the outbreak trajectories and clinical outcomes at the population level. However, effective interventions may also be vital when combating COVID-19. In this study, we divide the process of the spread into two phases: the initial period where the government and the public are not fully aware and the second period after community transmission that arouses people's alertness. We focus on the following questions. 

* How are countries performing when faced with the virus? 
* Are developed countries better at combatting the virus?
* Do intervention policies matter?

We find that most countries are doing better in the second phase and the spread of COVID-19 has slowed down. Among them, developed countries are not performing better. Some of them have a lot of cumulative cases and they even have higher case fatality rate. Furthermore, by using CCA, linear regression, and kernel CCA, we find that intervention policies do matter.
